    "description": "A multi-energy type control deck that leverages Raging Bolt and Ogerpon ex as primary attackers, supported by a robust utility engine featuring Fezandipiti ex for energy acceleration and Mew ex for versatile attacking options. The deck uses Area Zero Underdepths for draw consistency and multiple energy types (Fighting, Grass, Lightning) to power diverse threats.",
    "strategy": "This deck wins through sustained pressure with versatile attackers that can adapt to different matchups. Raging Bolt provides powerful Lightning-based offense, while Ogerpon ex offers Grass-type aggression. Fezandipiti ex serves as both an energy accelerator and secondary attacker. The deck uses Ditto as a flexible starter that can evolve into whatever the matchup requires, while Mew ex provides additional attacking versatility. Earthen Vessel and Energy Retrieval maintain energy flow, and Boss's Orders/Crispin provide crucial knockout timings. The deck grinds out wins through resource advantage and flexible threat deployment.",
