Reality Check - Oct 1, 2025
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

35 experiments logged
4 with verified P@10 on canonical test set

Performance ranking (real numbers only):
1. exp_021: Jaccard = 0.14
2. exp_023: Ensemble = 0.08  
3. exp_022: Node2Vec = 0.06
4. exp_028: Archetype = 0.00

Conclusion: No improvement across experiments.
Best is still first method tried (Jaccard).

Infrastructure built:
  ✓ Logging system
  ✓ Closed-loop
  ✓ Active learning
  ✓ Multi-game
  ✓ Meta-learner

Performance improvement: 0%

Issue: Building > Running
  31 infrastructure experiments
  4 actual experiments
  
Next: Stop building, start running.
Run 10 real experiments tomorrow.
No more frameworks until we have 20 verified P@10 numbers.
