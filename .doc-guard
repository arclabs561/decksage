# Documentation Guard

## Anti-Pattern Alert 🚨

If you're about to create a document that:
- Analyzes the current state
- Plans improvements  
- Reviews what was done
- Summarizes findings
- Tracks completion status

**STOP!**

Instead:
1. Update README.md if it's a core fact
2. Execute the fix directly
3. Archive old docs: `mv *_pattern*.md archive/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/`

## The Rule

**Never create a document about a documentation problem.**

If you find yourself typing `COMPLETE_`, `FINAL_`, `SUMMARY_`, or `ANALYSIS_` - you're probably creating process artifacts, not value.

## Quick Check

Before creating any .md file, ask:
- Will someone need this in 3 months?
- Does it help run the system?
- Is it the source of truth for something?

If no to all three → Don't create it.

---
Remember: The best documentation is no documentation.
The second best is a single source of truth.
