{"card1": "Thunderkin Awakener", "card2": "Stonewood Invocation", "similarity_score": 0.15, "similarity_type": "unrelated", "reasoning": "These cards have fundamentally different functions and cannot substitute for each other. Thunderkin Awakener (1R, 1/2 creature) is a recursive engine that reanimates Elementals with haste at combat, sacrificing them at end of turn - it's primarily used to repeatedly recur value Elementals like Ball Lightning or to enable combo lines. Stonewood Invocation (3G instant) is a combat trick that gives +5/+5 and split second to prevent interaction - it's a protective/pump spell.\n\nThe cards serve completely different roles: Awakener is a creature-based value engine/combo enabler, while Invocation is a one-shot combat trick/protection spell. They have no functional overlap - one is a permanent that generates repeated value, the other is a reactive instant. The co-occurrence in 12 decks likely reflects specific synergies where Invocation protects key Elemental creatures or Awakener itself in combat-heavy strategies, but this is deck-specific context rather than functional similarity.\n\nPower level wise, they're incomparable - Awakener is build-around engine, Invocation is situational support. Deckbuilding constraints differ significantly: Awakener requires Elemental tribal support, Invocation just needs green mana and creatures worth protecting.

Augur provides haste pressure and delayed token generation, functioning as a 2-for-1.\n\n3. **Different tribal synergies**: Migration creates Beasts (typically), while Augur creates Dinosaurs and is itself a Skeleton, supporting different tribal strategies.\n\n4. **Similar mana cost range**: Both are red-aligned cards that cost around 3-4 mana, making them somewhat comparable in curve placement.\n\nThey share archetype overlap (token generation, red aggressive strategies) but serve different tactical roles.
