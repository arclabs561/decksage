  "feedback": "The annotations show strong reasoning quality but suffer from severe score compression issues. All scores fall between 0.08-0.23 despite varying levels of card similarity. While the reasoning is detailed and well-structured, it's not translating into appropriate score differentiation.\n\nThe card data completeness issues in several annotations compromise the ability to make thorough comparisons. When card attribute data is missing, the annotations rely more heavily on general knowledge rather than specific card characteristics.\n\nThe scoring appears to treat all \"unrelated\" cards similarly instead of recognizing degrees of unrelatedness. For example, cards sharing a card type but nothing else score similarly to cards with no shared attributes at all.",
