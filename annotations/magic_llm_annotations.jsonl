Rendmaw's ability triggers when you play a card with two or more types (like artifact creatures or enchantment creatures), but it is primarily built as a 'discard/cycle' engine deck in Commander because of how its triggers interact with Goad and card filtering. Shadow of the Grave is a high-synergy piece in discard/cycling decks that returns cards to hand. While they don't share a function (one is a mass recursion spell, the other is a creature that creates tokens and goads), they are strongly linked by the 'cycling/discard' archetype.
