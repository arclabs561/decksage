{"card1": "Joraga Warcaller", "card2": "Towering Gibbon", "similarity_score": 0.5, "similarity_type": "archetype", "reasoning": "Both cards are green creature cards that fit into Elf tribal strategies, which explains their co-occurrence in 19 decks. However, they serve distinctly different functions:\n\nJoraga Warcaller is a scalable lord effect - it enters with +1/+1 counters based on kicker cost and gives other Elves +1/+1 for each counter on it. It's a payoff card that requires a critical mass of Elves to be effective and scales with mana investment.\n\nTowering Gibbon is a reach creature (likely with some combat-relevant stats) that provides defensive utility against flyers. It's more of a utility creature that happens to be an Elf.\n\nWhile both are green Elves that appear in similar tribal decks, they fill different roles: Warcaller is an anthem/lord effect for going wide, while Gibbon is defensive reach. The similarity score of 0.5 reflects that they share the same archetype (Elf tribal) but have non-overlapping functions. Towering Gibbon cannot replace Joraga Warcaller because you cannot substitute a defensive reach creature for a tribal lord - the deck construction would fundamentally change without the anthem effect.", "is_substitute": false, "context_dependent": true, "example_decks": ["Elf Tribal", "Green Aggro Elves", "Commander Elf Ball"], "model_name": "anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet", "model_params": {"provider": "openrouter"}, "prompt_hash": null, "annotator_id": null, "timestamp": "2026-01-05T14:33:14.055738", "game": "magic", "source": "llm", "card_comparison": {"card1_attrs": {"mana_cost": "{G}", "cmc": 1.0, "color_identity": [], "type": "Creature — Elf Warrior", "subtypes": [], "power": "1", "toughness": "1", "oracle_text": "Multikicker {1}{G} (You may pay an additional {1}{G} any number of times as you cast this spell.)\nThis creature enters with a +1/+1 counter on it for each time it was kicked.\nOther Elf creatures you control get +1/+1 for each +1/+1 counter on this creature.", "keywords": ["Multikicker"], "rarity": "rare"}, "card2_attrs": {"mana_cost": "{3}{G}", "cmc": 4.0, "color_identity": [], "type": "Creature — Ape", "subtypes": [], "power": "*", "toughness": "4", "oracle_text": "Reach\nTowering Gibbon's power is equal to the greatest mana value among creatures you control.", "keywords": ["Reach"], "rarity": "uncommon"}, "attribute_similarity": {"mana_cost": 0.0, "cmc": 0.7, "type": 0.7, "keywords": 0.0}, "functional_overlap": [], "differences": ["Joraga Warcaller is Creature — Elf Warrior, Towering Gibbon is Creature — Ape", "Joraga Warcaller costs {G}, Towering Gibbon costs {3}{G}", "Joraga Warcaller CMC 1.0, Towering Gibbon CMC 4.0"]}, "graph_features": {"cooccurrence_count": 0, "cooccurrence_frequency": 0.0, "jaccard_similarity": 0.0213903743315508, "graph_distance": null, "common_neighbors": 32, "total_neighbors_card1": 710, "total_neighbors_card2": 818, "clustering_coefficient": null, "edge_weight": null}}
