  "feedback": "The annotations show excellent reasoning depth and structure, but suffer from significant score clustering in the low range. While the analysis is thorough, it's not translating into appropriate score differentiation. The reasoning often identifies meaningful similarities (like shared archetypes or themes) but then assigns very low scores anyway, suggesting a disconnect between analysis and score assignment.\n\nThe annotations need better calibration for mid-range and high-range similarities. Currently, even cards with significant thematic and strategic overlap (like Jiang Yanggu and Rubblebelt Raiders) receive relatively low scores. The detailed analysis is actually identifying more similarity than the scores reflect.",
