  "feedback": "The annotations show strong attention to detail and excellent reasoning structure, but suffer from significant score clustering and consistency issues. While the full score range is technically used (0.12-0.97), there's a heavy bias toward low scores, with most falling below 0.3. The reasoning quality is high, with detailed analysis of graph features and clear justification structures, but the interpretation of similar graph features sometimes leads to different scores without clear justification.\n\nThe handling of high-similarity pairs (like the 0.97 example) is excellent, with detailed analysis of graph features and archetype context. However, the mid-range similarities are underrepresented, suggesting a tendency to push scores toward extremes.\n\nThe completeness and reasoning structure are particular strengths, with every annotation following a clear format and including all required information. The use of graph features is consistent and detailed, though the interpretation could be more standardized.",
