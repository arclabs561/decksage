Gives +1/+1 and flying. When the creature dies, you get a 4/4 Angel token.\n- Seraphic Steed: 2-mana White Creature (2/2). Has Mount. When it attacks while mounted, you get a 4/4 Angel token.\nBoth cards are 2-mana plays designed to generate a 4/4 flying Angel token for a very low cost. One is reactive (death trigger/protection), the other is proactive (attack trigger/Mount).\n\n2. **Attribute Comparison**:\n- Cost: Both are 1W (2 CMC).\n- Color: Both are White.\n- Output: Both produce a 4/4 white Angel creature token with flying.\n- Difference: One is an enchantment (Aura), one is a creature. Seraphic Steed can trigger multiple times if it survives, whereas On Wings of Gold is a one-shot effect upon death.\n\n3. **Archetype Context**:\nThey both fit into White Weenie, Tokens, or Aggro decks. They are both 'efficient token generators' that reward playing a creature-heavy strategy.\n\n4. **Co-occurrence/Jaccard**:\n19 decks of co-occurrence suggests a strong link in specific formats (likely Limited or specific Standard builds).\n\n5. **Score Calibration**:\n- Function: High (both make 4/4 Angels for 2 mana).\n- Power Level: Comparable. Steed has a higher ceiling (multiple angels), On Wings has a more guaranteed floor (buffs a creature then replaces it).\n- Similarity: 0.75.

Firefist Striker is a staple of Red Weenie/Aggro archetypes.\n5. **Score Calibration**: Since they are both 2-cost creatures, they aren't '0.0', but their functional and color differences place them firmly in the 'unrelated' to 'weak' category.
