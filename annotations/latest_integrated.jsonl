Betor, Kin to All is a 4/4 legendary creature for 2UR that cares about creatures sharing a creature type with Betor, giving them ward 1 and making them mutate for free when cast.\n\nThese cards have moderate synergy but serve different primary functions. Lore Drakkis is primarily a spell recursion engine that uses mutate as its trigger mechanism - you mutate it onto another creature to get back an instant/sorcery. Betor enables free mutate triggers by allowing you to mutate creatures onto it at no cost, making it an excellent enabler for mutate strategies.\n\nThey work well together in mutate-focused decks where Betor enables free mutate casts and Lore Drakkis provides spell recursion value. Their co-occurrence in 39 decks confirms this synergistic relationship. However, they cannot substitute for each other because:\n\n1. Different primary functions: Lore Drakkis = spell recursion; Betor = mutate cost reduction/enabler\n2. Betor is legendary and has different deckbuilding constraints\n3. Lore Drakkis can be cast as a mutate spell itself, while Betor is always a creature base\n4.
