# Validation Tiers

Different contexts require different levels of validation rigor. This clarifies when to be rigorous versus pragmatic.

## Tier 1: Production/Release (Rigorous)
- **When**: Code going to production, model releases, data pipeline changes
- **Requirements**:
  - Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e)
  - Performance benchmarks and regression checks
  - Security scanning (snyk_code_scan)
  - Documentation updates
  - Validation of all claims with evidence
- **Don't declare "production ready" or "complete" without this tier**

## Tier 2: Experimental/Development (Pragmatic)
- **When**: Prototyping, experiments, proof-of-concept work
- **Requirements**:
  - Basic functionality tests
  - Manual verification sufficient for initial validation
  - Document assumptions and limitations
  - Mark as experimental/alpha in code/comments
- **Principle**: "Pragmatic approximations that work now are better than optimal solutions requiring infrastructure you don't have"

## Tier 3: Quick Iteration (Minimal)
- **When**: Debugging, small fixes, refactoring with existing tests
- **Requirements**:
  - Run existing relevant tests
  - Verify fix doesn't break existing functionality
  - No new tests required for trivial changes

## Decision Framework
- **Default to Tier 2** (pragmatic) for new work
- **Upgrade to Tier 1** (rigorous) when:
  - Feature is ready for production use
  - Changes affect critical paths (data loading, training, evaluation)
  - User-facing changes or API modifications
- **Downgrade to Tier 3** (minimal) for:
  - Obvious bug fixes
  - Documentation-only changes
  - Refactoring with comprehensive existing test coverage
