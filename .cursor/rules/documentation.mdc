# Documentation

- Don't create excessive MD files for progress
- Improve code and comments as primary documentation
- Use code references for existing code, markdown blocks for new code
- Keep README.md current, archive outdated docs
- **Lineage documentation**: All data processing scripts MUST include lineage comments (see Data Lineage Architecture section)
- **Script documentation**: All scripts should include:
  - Purpose and usage in docstring
  - Required arguments and options
  - Example usage
  - Dependencies (data lineage orders, environment variables)
  - Error conditions and exit codes
- **Code comments**: Use comments to explain "why", not "what"
  - Document non-obvious decisions, performance optimizations, and workarounds
  - Include references to issues, PRs, or discussions when relevant
  - Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
